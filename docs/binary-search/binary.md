## Introduction
Binary search is a searching algorithm, used to search for an element in an array. It follows a unique approach which reduces the time complexity as compared to linear search. However, to use binary search, the array must be sorted. 

## Implementation

Let us see how to implement binary search in Java:

```java
        //let element to be found=target
		int low=0;
		int high=n-1; //where n is the length of the sorted array
        int mid; //represents the mid index of the array

        int flag=0; //element not yet found 

		while(low<=high) {

			mid=(low + high)/2;
			if(arr[mid]==target) {
				flag=1; //element found
				System.out.println("Target found!");
				break;
			}
			else if(arr[mid]<target) {
                // which means target is to the right of mid element
				low=mid+1;
			}
			else {
                //target is to the left of mid element
				high=mid-1;
			}
			
		}

		if(flag==0) {
			System.out.println("Target not found!");
		}
```
## Implementation

Let us see how to implement binary search in c++:\

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void binarySearch(const std::vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = arr.size() - 1;
    int mid;
    bool found = false; // element not yet found

    while (low <= high) {
        mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // to avoid potential overflow
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            found = true; // element found
            std::cout << "Target found!" << std::endl;
            break;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            // target is to the right of mid element
            low = mid + 1;
        }
        else {
            // target is to the left of mid element
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    if (!found) {
        std::cout << "Target not found!" << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; // example sorted array
    int target = 5; // example target

    binarySearch(arr, target);

    return 0;
}

```

In this algorithm, the searching interval of the array is divided into half at every iteration until the target is found. This results in lesser comparisions and decreases the time required.

## Time complexity:

Linear/Sequential search: O(n)<br />
Binary search : O(log n)

## Points to Remember:

- Binary search requires a sorted array.
- Works for 1 dimensional arrays.
- Faster and complex than sequential search.
- Uses the divide and conquer approach.
- Best if arrays are too long (large datasets).
